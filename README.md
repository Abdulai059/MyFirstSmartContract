# SIMPLESTORAGE SMART CONTRACT

This project contains a simple Solidity smart contract called `SimpleStorage` that allows for storing and retrieving an unsigned integer (`uint256`). The contract is written in Solidity version `^0.8.25`.

# FEATURES

- **Storage of a number**: Stores a `favoriteNumber` of type `uint256`.
- **Public getter**: Provides a public function to retrieve the stored number.

# GETTING STARTED

# Prerequisites

To interact with this contract, you will need:

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or any Solidity development environment

### INSTALLING

1. Clone this repository or use this contract in your own project.
2. Open it in Remix IDE or any other Solidity development environment.

### DEPLOYING THE CONTRACT

1. In Remix IDE, choose Solidity compiler `^0.8.25` and compile the contract.
2. Go to the `Deploy & Run Transactions` tab.
3. Select the desired environment (e.g., `Injected Web3` or `JavaScript VM`).
4. Deploy the contract.

### INTERACTING WITH THE CONTRACT

- Once deployed, you can retrieve the stored number using the `favoriteNumber()` function.
